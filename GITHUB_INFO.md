**Commit Message:**
```
Initial commit: Meta-Creation System

A self-replicating AI agent system where Creators can read their own
source code and create new Creator variants, enabling infinite recursive
depth and artificial evolution.

Features:
- Self-introspection: Creators read own source code
- Self-replication: Create functional Creator copies
- Self-modification: Each copy has variations
- Recursive creation: Creators create Creators
- Specialization: Each variant unique
